## The Six Priority Council Journeys

1. **Book and approve annual leave (Use Case 01):**
   - Aisha Khan submits annual leave with weekday calculations.
   - Helen Walker reviews the request, approving or rejecting with auditable state change.
   - Returning as Aisha confirms the decremented balance and approval record.
2. **Establishment & organisation hierarchy (Use Case 02):**
   - Review reporting lines, post grades, FTE, and cost centres.
   - Cost-centre and service roll-ups update dynamically when new staff are onboarded.
3. **Applicant-to-worker lifecycle (Use Case 03):**
   - Manager/Recruiter creates and publishes a vacancy with optional cover letter.
   - Candidate applies via the public careers portal and receives a private tracking token.
   - Candidate self-selects video or in-person interview slot and views recruiter correspondence.
   - Recruiter logs mandatory interview score (0-5) and feedback before issuing offer.
   - Onboarding automatically provisions a worker record, links onboarding tasks, and queues integration events.
4. **Document governance, retention & purge (Use Case 04):**
   - Employees upload classified files with retention deadlines.
   - HR archives eligible records; administrators simulate retention expiry for demo walkthroughs.
   - Eligible purge deletes expired archived records with full audit trail.
5. **People Services tasks & hand-offs (Use Case 05):**
   - Coordinated task assignments across employee, HR, and learning teams.
   - Optional HR casework module demonstrated transparently as an additional-cost option.
6. **Workforce insights & management information (Use Case 06):**
   - Dynamic grouping by department, cost centre, or grade across headcount, FTE, and salary.
   - Instant visual bar breakdown, filter search, and direct CSV export.
